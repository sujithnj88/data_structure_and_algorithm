# Sliding window

Sliding window is another common approach to solving problems related to arrays. A sliding window is actually implemented using two pointers! Before we start, we need to talk about the concept of a subarray.

# Subarrays

Given an array, a subarray is a contiguous section of the array. All the elements must be adjacent to each other in the original array and in their original order. For example, with the array [1, 2, 3, 4], the subarrays (grouped by length) are:

    [1], [2], [3], [4]
    [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]
    [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]
    [1, 2, 3, 4]

A subarray can be defined by two indices, the start and end. For example, with [1, 2, 3, 4], the subarray [2, 3] has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Let's call the starting index the left bound and the ending index the right bound. Another name for subarray in this context is "window".
